DEMO #3: 2D PARALLAX STARFIELD (The Starboard Window)
================================================================================
THE PARALLAX ALGORITHM:
This engine creates an array of "star" objects using floating-point coordinates 
to allow for smooth "sub-pixel" speed.

By moving the stars from Right to Left (decreasing the X coordinate), we 
trigger the human brain's natural association with looking out the side window 
of a moving vehicle. 

The core trick remains the brightness calculation. We multiply the star's 
color by its speed. This means a star moving at 0.1 speed is very dim 
(deep background), and a star moving at 0.9 speed is blindingly bright 
(foreground). When they overlap, the optical illusion of 3D depth is created.
