DEMO #4: CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE (Version 4.3 - Phosphor & Structural Density)
================================================================================
THE UPGRADES:
1. STRUCTURAL COLORING: The render engine now does a micro-scan of the 16 
   visible pixels. Supported cells (>=3 neighbors) paint Red. Exposed edges 
   (<3 neighbors) paint White.
2. PHOSPHOR DECAY (ANTI-FLICKER): Instead of instantly turning off, dead 
   pixels now smoothly fade to black. This motion blur eliminates the 
   strobe effect inherent to Game of Life oscillators and makes the 
   integer-based camera panning look perfectly smooth.
3. SPEED: Locked to 0.015 seconds per frame for comfortable visual tracking.
