DEMO #6: THE BEATING HEART (Version 6.1 - Hardware Anti-Aliasing)
================================================================================
THE UPGRADE:
To make the 4x4 heart look organic and not blocky (or like a Galaga space 
invader), we implemented Hardware Anti-Aliasing.

The 'blueprints' now store a third value: Per-Pixel Intensity (0.0 to 1.0).

In the FULL_HEART blueprint, we added coordinate (1, 0). That is the gap 
between the two humps. We assigned it an intensity of 0.15 (15%). By making 
that single pixel much dimmer, we visually "smooth" the edge of the humps, 
selling the illusion of a curved heart much better on a tiny resolution.
