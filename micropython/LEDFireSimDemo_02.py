DEMO #2: PROCEDURAL THERMODYNAMIC FIRE (Version 2.1)
================================================================================
THE DEMOSCENE ALGORITHM:
This code utilizes a legendary computer graphics technique pioneered by 
demoscene hackers in the early 1990s (and famously utilized for the fire 
effects in games like DOOM). 

Instead of trying to animate colors directly, this algorithm simulates real-world 
thermodynamics using a cellular automaton. It operates on a virtual "Heat Map" 
rather than a screen of pixels. 

The physics work in three distinct steps every single frame:
1. IGNITION: The very bottom row of the matrix acts as the "fuel source," randomly 
   spiking with maximum heat values (simulating sparking embers).
2. CONVECTION: That heat travels upwards to the next row, but slightly drifts 
   left or right to simulate wind and natural flame flicker.
3. COOLING: As the heat rises away from the fuel source, it rapidly decays. 

Finally, the raw "temperature" data (0 to 255) is passed through a color palette 
function that maps cold values to Black, warm values to Red, hot to Orange, and 
intense heat to Yellow. By simulating the physics of heat rather than the look of 
fire, the resulting animation is organically chaotic and highly realistic.
